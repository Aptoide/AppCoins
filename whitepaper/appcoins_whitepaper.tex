\begin{abstract}

Today there are 2.1 bn smartphone users in the world generating more than USD77 bn in annual gross revenue. Those numbers are projected to double by 2020. However, app stores are still riddled with inefficiencies and malware. In-app purchases (IAP) are not accessible to the low-end market, in-app advertising is plagued by too many intermediaries, malware is still prevalent and innovation is slowing down.

\medskip

The reasons are diverse: payment models are not suited for emerging countries and younger generations; there is no trust between the actors of the ecosystem; and there is a lack of standardisation defining clear interfaces and enabling market free entry for new players.

\medskip

The AppCoins network is an open and distributed protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to mitigate the current inherent deficiencies of app stores. By marrying blockchain technology with app store technology, app advertising, in-app billing and app-approval can be drastically improved and sped up through disintermediation and redistributing the unlocked value to end-users and developers. ``AppCoin'' ERC20 token will be used by the developers to advertise their Apps to the users. From every advertising investment inside the app store, 85\% goes to the user. The user has to use those coins to buy items (in-app purchase) inside the apps and games, generating the return of the investment to the developers. In parallel, the Advertising and IAB transactions are used to establish the reputation of the developer.

\medskip

The design of the AppCoins protocol rests on three main pillars: 1) transparency, 2) equitability and 3) community-focused. Firstly, open and transparent standards facilitate trust and privacy. Secondly, revenue shares are redistributed away from unnecessary intermediaries to end-users and developers. Thirdly, through open-source code, knowledge is accessible to the community. 

\medskip

The current problems in the app stores flows are further described in this document, as well as the risks contained in each of them. Concepts like ``proof-of-attribution'', use Ethereum network smart contracts and state storage, allowing cryptographically to reach an acceptable digital agreement between users and developers.


\medskip

This new AppCoins power app economy network will be launched within the next 12 months, leveraging on existing 200 million annual unique active users of the Aptoide app store. Token sale proceeds will be used to incentivise developers, OEMs and end-users. By 2022, Aptoide aims that 1.3 bn people use AppCoins powered app stores.

\begin{abstract}

%Today there are 2.1 bn smartphone users in the world and the number is expected to grow to 4 billion in 2020. To install apps and games, those mobile users use app stores. An app store is the distribution channel between the developer and the user. App stores generate more than \$77 billion yearly in gross revenue.  However, they seem to be incapable of solving the most basic issues that harm the app store experience: inaccessibility of in-app purchases, advertising model intermediation, malware and lack of innovation.
Today there are 2.1 bn smartphone users in the world generating more than USD77 bn in annual gross revenue. Those numbers are projected to double by 2020. However, app stores are still riddled with inefficiencies and malware. In-app purchases (IAP) are not accessible to the low-end market, in-app advertising is plagued by too many intermediaries, malware is still prevalent and innovation is slowing down.

\medskip

%The reasons are diverse: inadequacy of payment models to emergent countries and younger generations, no trust between the actors of the ecosystem and lack of standardisation defining clear interfaces and enabling market free entry for new players.
The reasons are diverse: payment models are not suited for emerging countries and younger generations; there is no trust between the actors of the ecosystem; and there is a lack of standardisation defining clear interfaces and enabling market free entry for new players.

%AppCoins is an open and distributed protocol for app stores. It proposes to move to the blockchain three of the most critical flows of app stores: advertising, in-app billing and developer approval. By redesigning the transactions inside the app stores, it creates efficiencies by disintermediation and redistributes the value released in a way that create incentives for the AppCoins supported stores dissemination.
The AppCoins network is an open and distributed protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to mitigate the current inherent deficiencies of app stores. By marrying blockchain technology with app store technology, app advertising, in-app billing and app-approval can be drastically improved and sped up through disintermediation and redistributing the unlocked value to end-users and developers.

\medskip

%The redesign of the app stores' processes is based on blockchain technology. An Ethereum ERC20 compliant token named ``AppCoin'' will be used by the developers to advertise their Apps to the users. From every advertising investment inside the app store, 85\% goes to the user. The user has to use those coins to buy items (in-app purchase) inside the apps and games, generating the return of the investment to the developers. In parallel, the Advertising and IAB transactions are used to establish the reputation of the developer.
The design of the AppCoins network rests on three main pillars: 1) transparency, 2) equitability and 3) community-focused. Firstly, open and transparent standards facilitate trust and privacy. Secondly, revenue shares are redistributed away from unnecessary intermediaries to end-users and developers. Thirdly, through open-source code, knowledge is accessible to the community.

\medskip

The current problems in the app stores flows are further described in this document, as well as the risks contained in each of them. Concepts like ``proof-of-attribution'', use Ethereum network smart contracts and state storage, allowing cryptographically to reach an acceptable digital agreement between users and developers.

%\medskip

%The design of the protocol received contributions of players in the app store industry as well as the blockchain community, aiming to change the app distribution in 3 ways: ``open'' with open standards that enables trust and privacy, ``circular'' where the value created in a transaction is not drained by intermediaries but flows in a virtuous loop, and ``shared'' where knowledge and open source code benefits every member of the community.

\medskip

%The bootstrap of the protocol will be accomplished in the next 12 months, using the 200 million yearly unique active users of the Aptoide app store user base, and leveraging the tokens not distributed in the ICO to incentivise developers, OEMs and users to use technology powered by the protocol.
This new AppCoins power app economy network will be launched within the next 12 months, leveraging on existing 200 million annual unique active users of the Aptoide app store. Token sale proceeds will be used to incentivise developers, OEMs and end-users. By 2022, Aptoide aims that 1.3 bn people use AppCoins powered app stores.

%The protocol will reach the full maturity in 2022 when 1.3 bn people will use AppCoins-supported app store.

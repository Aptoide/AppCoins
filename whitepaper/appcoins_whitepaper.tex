\begin{abstract}
App Coins is an open and distributed protocol for App Stores. Platform agnostic. 
By redesigning the transactions inside an App Store - such as Advertising, In-App Billing and App approval, creates efficiencies by disintermediation and redistributes the value released in a way that create incentives for App Store dissemination.
The protocol is being supported by Aptoide, an App Store wih 142 million unique users in 2016.

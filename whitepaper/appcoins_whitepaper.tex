\begin{abstract}

There are today, in 2017, 2.1 billion smartphone users in the world and the number is expected to grow to  4 billion in 2020. To install apps and games, those mobile users use app stores. An app store is the distribution channel between the developer and the user. App stores generate more that \$77 billion yearly in gross revenue.  However, they seem to be incapable of solving the most basic issues that harm the app store experience: inaccessibility of in-app purchases, advertising model intermediation, malware and lack of innovation.

\medskip

The reasons are diverse: inadequacy of payment models to emergent countries and younger generations, no trust between the actors of the ecosystem and lack of standardisation defining clear interfaces and enabling market free entry for new players.

\medskip

AppCoins is an open and distributed protocol for app stores. It proposes to move to the blockchain three of the most critical flows of app stores: advertising, in-app billing and developers approval. By redesigning the transactions inside the app stores, creates efficiencies by disintermediation and redistributes the value released in a way that create incentives for the AppCoins supported stores dissemination.

\medskip

The redesign of the app stores processes is based in blockchain technology. An Ethereum ERC20 compliant token named ``AppCoin'' will be used by the developers to advertise their Apps to the users. From every advertising investment inside the app store, 85\% goes to the user. The user have to use those coins to buy items (in-app purchase) inside the apps and games, generating the return of the investment to the developers. In parallel, the Advertising and IAB transactions are used to establish the reputation of the developer.

\medskip

The current problems in the app stores flows are further described in this document, as well as the risks contained in each of them. Concepts like ``proof-of-attribution'', use Ethereum network smart contracts and state storage, allowing cryptographically to reach an acceptable digital agreement between users and developers.

\medskip

The design of the protocol received contributions of players in the app store industry as well as the blockchain community, aiming to change the apps distribution in 3 ways: ``open'' with open standards that enables trust and privacy, ``circular'' where the value created in a transaction is not drained by intermediaries but flows in a virtuous loop, and ``shared'' where knowledge and open source code benefits every member of the community.

\medskip

The bootstrap of the protocol will be accomplished in the next 12 months, using the 200 million yearly unique active users of Aptoide app store user base, and leveraging the tokens not distributed in the ICO to incentivise developers, OEMs and users to use technology powered by the protocol.

\medskip

The goal is to have 1.3 billion people using AppCoins supported app stores by 2022.

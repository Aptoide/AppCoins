\section{Design of the Solution}

\label{sec:design}


\subsection{Requirements and Assumptions }

% A table 

The design of the platform was made having the following assumptions:

P1 - Crowdsourcing: community wisdom works for big numbers better than individual wisdom

P2 - Incentives: If there are enough incentives, community contributes

P3 - A new developer is always an unkown developer

P4 - The Apps from a Trusted Developer are Trusted Apps

P5 - In a dispute, if 50\% + 1 of the community is honest, the right side wins

P6 - Transactions registered in the blockchain ledger (IAB, Ads) reflects well the trustworthness of a developer.

P7 - If the app downloads made by the users come from more than 5\% of unknown developers, users will start to trust in unknown developers.

P8 - A community dispute may take 30 days. While the dispute is handled, the app stores have the option of hiding the app to avoid zero-day attacks.
